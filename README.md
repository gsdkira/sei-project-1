# Project One - Supermarket Game

## Idea Overview

In this game our player is living their daily life shopping in the supermarket. The player is trying to make the healthiest choices as possible but is always presented with obstacles in their journey. The goal is for our person to buy as much healthy foods as possible while avoiding processed foods like twinkies and chips! If the player buys too much processed foods your energy level will go down and you'll eventually have a heart attack! 

The player will be moving side to side to avoid these obsticles. 



# Technical Overview

I plan on using canvas to create a sort of retro game. The player will use WSAD keys to manuever.
