# Project One - Supermarket Game

## Idea Overview

In this game our player is living their daily life shopping in the supermarket. The player is trying to make the healthiest choices as possible but is always presented with obstacles in their journey. The goal is for our person to avoid processed foods like twinkies and chips and shop for spinach and watermelon instead! If the player buys too much processed foods your energy level will go down and you'll eventually have a heart attack! 

The player will be moving side to side to avoid these obstacles.
